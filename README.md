# stat-fact-sheets

These are several pages of relatively condensed facts about mathematical
statistics that I put together while taking Statistics 512 and 513
at University of Washington during Autumn of 1996 and Winter of
1997.  The courses were taught by Elizabeth A. Thompson.  I was a 
Master's student in Fisheries at the time.

The organization of the material follows the order in which we studied the
different topics in the course.  The textbook that we used was 
*Statistical Inference* by Casella and Berger.

I am releasing them here under the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt) because
John Novembre was wondering if he could get a copy of them.  

They are written in LaTeX and should compile on any standard LaTeX system.

Feel free to do what you would like with them.  I hope they are useful
to you.  I know there are a couple typos in them.  If you find any typos
or errors, and you feel inclined, please send me a pull request with your
updates.

Cheers,

Eric C. Anderson
